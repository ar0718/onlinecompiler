# Online Compiler Project
### Current status: Backend Under Developement

Welcome to the **Online Compiler** project! This is an ongoing development effort to build a robust backend for an online code compilation platform using Django. The backend will serve as the foundation for a future full-stack application, enabling users to write, compile, and execute code securely within a sandboxed environment.

---

## ðŸš§ Project Status: Under Development ðŸš§

The project is **not yet ready for production use**. Features and functionalities are being actively developed, tested, and improved.

---

## Vision

The goal of this project is to provide a scalable and secure backend for an online compiler that supports multiple programming languages. This platform will be designed for:
- Students and educators for learning and teaching programming.
- Developers testing code snippets without needing a local environment.
- Organizations conducting coding assessments or competitions.

Planned features include:
- Support for various programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
- Real-time compilation and execution with instant feedback.
- REST APIs to integrate with a future front-end application.
- A secure and isolated execution environment to handle user code.

---

## Installation Guide

To run the backend locally, follow the steps below:

#### Note: *We are using docker to sandbox the user submitted code, hence make sure to have docker installed, following images available.*
----------

### **1. Install Docker**

-   **For Linux:** Follow the [official Docker installation guide for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
-   **For macOS:** Use [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
-   **For Windows:** Use [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

### **2. Set Up Docker Group (Optional for Linux)**
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker  # Apply group changes without logout

```

### **3. Pull Required Docker Images**

Ensure the following Docker images are installed on the user's system:

-   **Python image** (for running the Python code)
-   **GCC image** (for compiling and running C++ code)
-   **OpenJDK image** (for compiling and running Java code)

```bash
docker pull python:3.10      # Python image for running Python code
docker pull gcc:latest       # GCC image for compiling C++ code
docker pull openjdk:latest   # OpenJDK image for compiling and running Java code

```
We will run our codes in these images instead of directly running on our system.

### **4. Verify Docker Images Are Installed**

After pulling the images, users can verify that they are installed by running:

```bash
docker images
```
This will list all the Docker images available, and you should see `python:3.10`, `gcc:latest`, and `openjdk:latest` in the output.

**Also make sure docker is running by running `sudo systemctl start docker` command in terminal.** Now, you can proceed to set up the project.
------------
### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ``` bash
   git clone https://github.com/premagarwals/onlinecompiler.git
   cd onlinecompiler
	```


2.  **Create a Virtual Environment**
    
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
    
3.  **Install Dependencies** Install the required Python libraries by running:
    
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
4.  **Run the Development Server** Start the Django development server:
    
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    
    The server will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.


## Future Roadmap

-   **Multi-language Support**: Add compiler support for Python, Java, C++, and more.
-   **RESTful APIs**: Provide APIs for front-end integration and external usage.
-   **Secure Execution**: Implement sandboxed environments for running untrusted user code.
-   **Error Handling**: Develop robust error reporting and debugging tools.
-   **Testing**: Add unit tests and integration tests for all APIs.

Stay tuned for updates!
